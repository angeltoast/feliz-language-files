English language file for Feliz
by Elizabeth Audrey Mills (liz@feliz.one) 31 December 2017
-----------------------------------------------------------
Notes to translators (use a text editor, such as notepad, and turn Line-numbers on)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Please translate line #1 to say the translation language;
2) Please translate line #2 to change from my name and email address to yours ...
   (it is your work and you deserve to be recognised for it);
3) Translations start at line #19
4) Please translate all lines at exactly the same line number as in this file,
    and do not add or delete any lines (this is very important);
5) If any translated line will be over 80 characters, please re-phrase to make it shorter
6) Save your file as <Language>.lan
   (where <Language> is the English name of the language - for example: Spanish.lan)
7) If you have any questions or problems, please email or contact me through Facebook
