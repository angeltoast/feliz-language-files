Notes to translators
--------------------
Use a text editor, such as notepad, or a programmers' editor like Geany, and
turn line-numbers on.

Make a copy of the English.lan file, named for your language eg: German.lan

Please translate all lines at exactly the same line number as in the English.lan
file, because that is how the translation system works. Do not add or delete
any lines anywhere (this is very important).

Some lines in the English file have the words linked with underscores - eg:
     Enter_Manually
This is because they are used in simple, 'one-word-per-line' menus, so please
make sure to also link the words on that line of your translation with
underscores or hyphens. Also, for the same reason, if a line in the English.lan
file is only one word, and if your translation is more than one word, please
link your words with underscores or hyphens.

Tha Arch Linux console in which the installation of Feliz runs is only 80
characters wide, so if any translated line will be over 80 characters, please
re-phrase to make it shorter (preferably less than 70 characters, as some
lines have to fit complex menus).

You may edit this file to help each other.

If you have any questions or problems, please email me:
    liz@feliz.one
or contact me through Facebook.

Thank you for your contribution to Feliz
